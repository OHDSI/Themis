# THEMIS

## Introduction
OHDSI Community: Themis makes decisions for the good of the whole community. We must compromise. We can always revisit and modify the convention. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. And interoperability between different OMOP CDMs is great! 


What falls under Themis & what does not. Some questions regarding the CDM would fall under the CDM WG domain, Vocab Team’s domain, and/or other areas of the OHDSI community 
•	CDM WG: Model changes 
•	Vocab Team: A missing Vocabulary, concept_id, or vocabulary representation 
•	Themis: Lack of a convention 
o	Multiple places to store or represent a data element 
o	Required data element not present at the source (example: year of birth) 
o	Multiple data points for a field containing a single data element (example: multiple provider specialties) 
o	General questions about how, where, when, why to store a data element 
o	Make recommendations to CDM & Vocab WGs 

## Topic Processing

Green figures represent where anyone can participate, while blue figures represent tasks THEMIS group members will work on.

1. Anyone in the OHDSI community can propose an idea for change, with or without a solution.  To do that, go to the THEMIS GitHub and add an issue labeled as "NEW".

2. The issues will be reviewed by THEMIS members and assigned a label

3. The THEMIS group responsible for this will debate it and make a posting to the forum tagged THEMIS to solicit feedback.

4. Allow for general OHDSI discussion on the forum.

5. After the THEMIS group is confident that they have gathered enough feedback they will close the initial issue and open a formalized recommendation issue labeled as "UNDER REVEIW".

6. There will be periodic all-hands THEMIS working group and at this point all "UNDER REVIEW" tasks will be reviewed to see which are ready for final approval.

7. Issues that are deemed ready will go into a 60 day review process by the OHDSI community.  It gives the community one last shot to provide feedback.

8A. If the recommendation is accepted, the actions are followed, in most cases this will be a task provided to the CDM/Vocabulary WG, update to ACHILLES, or update to OMOP Vocabulary.

8B. If the recommendation is rejected it will be labeled as such and notes of why it was rejected will be made on the issue.
