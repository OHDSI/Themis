# THEMIS  
The Themis convention library contains all ratified conventions and is located <a href="http://forums.ohdsi.org/tags/themis">here.</a>

## Introduction
OHDSI Community: Themis makes decisions for the good of the whole community. We must compromise. We can always revisit and modify the convention. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. And interoperability between different OMOP CDMs is great! 


**What falls under Themis & what does not**. Some questions regarding the CDM would fall under the CDM WG domain, Vocab Team’s domain, and/or other areas of the OHDSI community 

•	**CDM WG:** Model changes 

•	**Vocab Team:** A missing Vocabulary, concept_id, or vocabulary representation 

•	**Themis:** Lack of a convention 

   o	Multiple places to store or represent a data element 

  o	Required data element not present at the source (example: year of birth) 

  o	Multiple data points for a field containing a single data element (example: multiple provider specialties) 

  o	General questions about how, where, when, why to store a data element 

  o	Make recommendations to CDM & Vocab WGs
